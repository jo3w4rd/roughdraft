<h1 id="host-migration">Host Migration</h1>

<p>In a multiplayer network game without a dedicated server, one of the game instances acts as the host - the center of authority for the game. This is a player whose game is acting as a server and a &quot;local client&quot;, while the other players each run a “remote client”. See documentation on <a href="UNetConcepts.html">network system concepts</a> for more information.</p>
<p>If the host disconnects from the game, gameplay cannot continue. Common reasons for a host to disconnect include the host player leaving, the host process crashing, the host’s machine shutting down, or the host losing network connection.</p>
<p>The <strong>host migration</strong> feature allows one of the remote clients to become the new host, so that the multiplayer game can continue.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>During a multiplayer game with host migration enabled,Unity distributes the addresses of all peers (players, including the host and all clients) to all other peers in the game. When the host disconnects, one peer becomes the new host. The other peers then connect to the new host, and the game continues.</p>
<p>The Network Migration Manager component uses the Unity Networking HLAPI. It allows the game to continue with a new host after the original host disconnects. The screenshot below shows the migration state displayed in the Network Migration Manager, in the Inspector window.</p>
<p><img src="../uploads/Main/NetworkMigrationManagerInspector.png" alt="The Network Migration Manager component"></p>
<p>The Network Migration Manager provides a basic user interface, similar to the <a href="UNetManager.html">Network Manager HUD</a>. This user interface is for testing and prototyping during game development; before you release your game you should implement a custom user interface for host migration, and custom logic for actions like choosing the new host automatically without requiring input from the user.</p>
<p><img src="../uploads/Main/NetworkMigrationManagerHUD.png" alt="The Network Migration Manager prototyping HUD"></p>
<p>Even though the migration may have occurred because the old host lost connection or quit the game, it is possible for the old host of the game to rejoin the game as a client on the new host.</p>
<p>During a host migration, Unity maintains the state of <a href="ScriptRef:Networking.SyncVarAttribute.html">SyncVars</a> and <a href="ScriptRef:Networking.SyncList_1.html">SyncLists</a> on all networked GameObjects in the Scene. This also applies to custom serialized data for GameObjects.</p>
<p>Unity disables all of the player GameObjects in the game when the host disconnects. Then, when the other clients rejoin the new game on the new host, the corresponding players Unit re-enables those clients on the new host, and respawns them on the other clients. This ensures that Unity does not lose player state data during a host migration.</p>
<p>NOTE: During a host migration, Unity only preserves data that is available to clients. If data is only on the server, then it is not available to the client that becomes the new host. Data on the host is only available after a host migration if it is in SyncVars or SyncLists.</p>
<p>When the client becomes a new host, Unity invokes the callback function <a href="ScriptRef:Networking.NetworkBehaviour.OnStartServer.html">OnStartServer</a> for all networked GameObjects. On the new host, the Network Migration Manager uses the function <a href="ScriptRef:Networking.NetworkMigrationManager.BecomeNewHost.html">BecomeNewHost</a> to construct a networked server Scene from the state in the current <a href="ScriptRef:Networking.ClientScene.html">ClientScene</a>.</p>
<p>In a game with host migration enabled, peers are identified by their <a href="ScriptRef:Networking.NetworkSystem.PeerInfoMessage-connectionId.html">connectionId</a> on the server. When a client reconnects to the new host of a game, Unity passes this connectionId to the new host so that it can match this client with the client that was connected to the old host. This Id is on the <code>ClientScene</code> as the <a href="ScriptRef:Networking.ClientScene-reconnectId.html">reconnectId</a>.</p>
<h2 id="non-player-gameobjects">Non-Player GameObjects</h2>
<p>Non-player GameObjects with client authority are also handled by host migration. Unity disables and re-enables client-owned non-player GameObjects in the same way it disables and re-enables player GameObjects.</p>
<h2 id="identifying-peers">Identifying Peers</h2>
<p>Before the host disconnects, all the peers are connected to the host. They each have a unique connectionId on the host - this is called the <a href="ScriptRef:Networking.NetworkSystem.ReconnectMessage-oldConnectionId.html">oldConnectionId</a> in the context of host migration.</p>
<p>When the Network Migration Manager chooses a new host, and the peers reconnect to it, they supply their <code>oldConnectionId</code> to identify which peer they are. This allows the new host to match this reconnecting client to the corresponding player GameObject.</p>
<p>The old host uses a special <code>oldConnectionId</code> of zero to reconnect - because it did not have a connection to the old host, it WAS the old host. There is a constant <a href="ScriptRef:Networking.ClientScene.ReconnectIdHost.html">ClientScene.ReconnectIdHost</a> for this.</p>
<p>When you use the Network Migration Manager’s built-in user interface, the Network Migration Manager sets the <code>oldConnectionId</code> automatically. To set it manually, use <a href="ScriptRef:Networking.NetworkMigrationManager.Reset.html">NetworkMigrationManager.Reset</a> or <a href="ScriptRef:Networking.ClientScene.SetReconnectId.html">ClientScene.SetReconnectId</a>.</p>

</code></pre><h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>For host migration to work properly, you need to go to the GameObject’s Network Manager component and enable <strong>Auto Create Player</strong>. Data that is only present on the server (the host) is lost when the host disconnects. For games to be able to perform host migration correctly, important data must be distributed to the clients, not held secretly on the server.</p>
<p>This works for direct connection games. Additional work is required for this to function with the matchmaker and relay server.</p>
