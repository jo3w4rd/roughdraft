<p><a href="vr-input.html">Virtual Reality Input</a>Google VR is the technology behind both <a href="https://developers.google.com/vr/daydream/overview">Google Daydream</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/vr/cardboard/overview">Google Cardboard</a> VR platforms. Google VR encompasses support for smartphones, head mounted viewers and controllers, standalone head mounted displays and applications. Google VR provides an SDK for Unity that allows you to build VR content for this rich ecosystem of devices.</p>
<p>Google VR technologies includes Daydream, a platform for high quality mobile VR and Cardboard, built for bite-size VR experiences and 360 video. Daydream consists of Daydream-ready phones, headsets, controllers and experiences and supports high-end Android mobile devices through <a href="https://vr.google.com/daydream/smartphonevr/phones/">Daydream</a>. See the full list of Daydream devices on the <a href="https://vr.google.com/daydream/smartphonevr/phones/">Google VR</a>) website. <a href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/developers/">Cardboard</a> works with almost any smartphone on both iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Google Cardboard is the most accessible mobile VR solution, allowing anyone with an iOS or Android smartphone to experience VR apps. Cardboard does have minimum and recommended requirements for its usage, but these are much less hardware-bound than Daydream, focusing mainly on the operating system and basic control systems (such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope">gyroscope</a>). Users can view VR apps with an official Google Cardboard viewing device, or a third-party VR viewing device which supports Google VR content (See Hardware and Software Requirements section). Cardboard also supports a range of third-party handheld controllers, for apps which require more complex interactions.</p>
<p>Daydream allows more feature-rich experiences than Cardboard, but only supports Daydream ready devices such as  Daydream-ready phones, built for VR with high-resolution displays, smooth graphics and high fidelity sensors for precise head tracking. Daydream phone apps are accessible with the Daydream View, Google’s headset and motion controller for experiencing high quality VR, using a Daydream-ready phone. Daydream will also support a Daydream Standalone HMD built by original design manufacturers. Daydream Standalone is an untethered head mounted display running on the Android OS including richer controller input and motion tracking.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://developers.google.com/vr/">Google’s VR documentation</a> for more information about the requirements and functionality of Cardboard and Daydream.</p>
<h2 id="hardware-and-software-requirements"><strong>Hardware and software requirements</strong></h2>

<p>The minimum platform requirement for Cardboard is Android 5.0 (Lollipop) (SDK API level 21). </p>
<p>To ensure Unity uses the correct APK, and only runs on devices upgraded to the latest version of Android, you need to change the <strong>Minimum API Level</strong>.</p>
<p>To do this, go to Player Settings and navigate to <strong>Other Settings</strong>. Under <strong>Identification,</strong> use the <strong>Minimum API Level</strong> drop-down to set it to the latest API in the list.</p>
<p>Set the <strong>Target API Level</strong> to API level 21 or higher for Cardboard only. If you are targeting Daydream then this needs to be 24 or higher. By default, this property uses the highest level you have installed. For more information about API levels for Android, see documentation on <a href="class-PlayerSettingsAndroid.html">Android PlayerSettings</a>.</p>
<p>You are now ready to create your Unity content for Cardboard. Follow the same workflow you would for normal Android or iOS development (see documentation on <a href="android.html">Android development</a> or <a href="iphone.html">iOS development</a> for more information). Make sure you build and run your game on a Cardboard-capable device (menu: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Build &amp; Run</strong>).</p>

<p>Properties available for Daydream in Unity Player Settings</p>
<p>The minimum platform requirement for targeting Daydream only is Android 7.0 (Nougat) (SDK API level 24). If you are targeting Cardboard as well as Daydream, then the minimum supported API level is 21.</p>
<p>To ensure Unity uses the correct APK, and only runs on devices upgraded to the latest version of Android, you need to change the <strong>Minimum API Level</strong>.</p>
<p>To do this in the Player Settings, navigate to <strong>Other Settings</strong>. Under <strong>Identification,</strong> use the <strong>Minimum API Level</strong> drop-down to set it to the latest API in the list. </p>
<p>Set <strong>Target API Level</strong> should be set to API level 24 if you are Daydream. By default, this property uses the highest level you have installed. For more information about API levels for Android, see documentation on <a href="class-PlayerSettingsAndroid.html">Android PlayerSettings</a>.</p>
<p>You are now ready to create your Unity content for Daydream. Follow the same workflow you would for normal Android development (see documentation on <a href="android.html">Android development</a> for more information). Make sure you build and run your game on a Daydream-capable device (menu: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Build &amp; Run</strong>).</p>
<h2 id="working-with-google-vr-for-unity"><strong>Working with Google VR for Unity</strong></h2>
<p>This section covers important considerations you should keep in mind when creating Google VR content in Unity. </p>
<p>When working with Google VR for Unity, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the device names daydream and cardboard to load a specific device when you want to enable XR for that device. To do this, call <a href="ScriptRef:XR.XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName.html">XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName</a> and pass in the string name of the device.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Integration of Daydream for Unity takes over the Unity activity’s view hierarchy. This means that any modification made to the view hierarchy before initializing Daydream for Unity, is removed while in XR mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The SkipPermissionsDialog manifest entry is set to true when an application targeting Cardboard or Daydream is built. This is per Google specification and is done so as to minimize the chance of the user experience being disrupted by dropping out of VR.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="daydream-and-cardboard"><strong>Daydream and Cardboard</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Daydream</strong> and <strong>Cardboard</strong> have separate entries in the <strong>Virtual Reality SDKs</strong> list (<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Project Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Player</strong> &gt; <strong>XR Settings</strong>). Unity reads the list from top to bottom until it finds a device configuration that works. </p>
<p>Removing or reordering the SDKs in the list affects the functionality of your final built application, as detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If both <strong>Daydream</strong> and <strong>Cardboard</strong> are in the <strong>Virtual Reality SDKs</strong> list, asynchronous reprojection is enabled if running on hardware that supports it. <strong>Sustained Performance Mode</strong> is enabled if running on hardware that supports it, and if you have enabled it in the <strong>Player Settings</strong> (see previous section on targeting Daydream). The app appears in all Google Play Stores.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If <strong>Cardboard</strong> is above <strong>Daydream</strong> in the <strong>Virtual Reality SDKs</strong> list, the application might not run in Daydream mode, even on Daydream hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If <strong>Daydream</strong> is the only item in the <strong>Virtual Reality SDKs</strong> list, Unity adds XR Android manifest entries so that the app appears in the XR-specific Google Play store. Daydream requires asynchronous reprojection, so all devices which support Daydream also support asynchronous reprojection.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If <strong>Cardboard</strong> is the only item in the <strong>Virtual Reality SDKs</strong> list, the app does not appear in the Google VR Play store. Asynchronous reprojection and <strong>Sustained Performance Mode</strong> are disabled, even on capable hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you plan to support GearVR as well as Daydream and Cardboard, place <strong>Oculus</strong> at the top of the list. Phones that support GearVR run through the GearVR SDK, and phones that don’t support it fall back to <strong>Daydream</strong> or <strong>Cardboard</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you add <strong>None</strong> as the first device in the list, Unity starts as a normal application and you can toggle XR through script. See API documentation on <a href="ScriptRef:XR.XRSettings-enabled.html">XRSettings.enabled</a> and <a href="ScriptRef:XR.XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName.html">XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cardboard-for-ios"><strong>Cardboard for iOS</strong></h3>
<p>Google distributes the <strong>Cardboard Native Development Kit</strong> (NDK) for iOS through the <a href="https://cocoapods.org">Cocoapods library management system</a>. The Unity integration of Google VR uses a specific version of the <strong>Cardboard NDK</strong> from the Cocoapods manager and this NDK is also used to create your XCode project.</p>
<p>This means the resulting project is generated differently from a standard Unity project. Cocoapods creates a wrapping <strong>XCode</strong> workspace containing the Unity project as well as a project for the <strong>Cardboard</strong> <strong>NDK</strong> library and its dependencies. Always make sure that you open and/or use the workspace and not just the project to avoid linker errors due to the missing libraries in Cocoapods.</p>
<h3 id="magic-window-mode"><strong>Magic Window mode</strong></h3>
<p>During development, you may want to have a <strong>non-stereoscopic view</strong> which still utilizes headtracking. This is useful if you require the user to view a 2D image in <strong>XR</strong>, or to provide 2D previews of your <strong>XR application</strong>. This can also be useful for promotional materials. To achieve this, you can access <strong>head tracking data</strong> when the <a href="ScriptRef:XR.XRSettings-enabled.html"><strong>XRSettings.enabled</strong></a> property is false and the <a href="ScriptRef:XR.XRSettings-loadedDeviceName.html"><strong>XRSettings.loadedDeviceName</strong></a> is set to <strong>daydream</strong> or <strong>cardboard</strong>.</p>
<p>The following example C# code rotates the main camera in a scene by using XR head tracking while disabling stereoscopic view using <strong>XRSettings</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>UnityEngine.XR.XRSettings.enabled = false;
Camera.main.GetComponent&lt;Transform&gt;().localRotation = UnityEngine.XR.InputTracking.GetLocalRotation(XRNode.CenterEye);
</code></pre><p>For more information on the above, see the API documentation on <a href="ScriptRef:XR.XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName.html">XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hardware-volume-controls"><strong>Hardware volume controls</strong></h3>
<p>The Daydream SDK for Unity prevents the native Operating System (OS) from accessing the device’s volume controls. This prevents the OS from displaying the volume user interface (UI) when in XR mode. To access the device’s volume controls manually, extend the standard <strong>UnityPlayerActivity </strong>(the primary Java class for the Unity Player on Android) and override the onKeyDown and onKeyLongPress key event functions yourself.</p>
<p>For more information on this process, see the Unity documentation on <a href="AndroidUnityPlayerActivity.html">extending the UnityPlayerActivity class</a> through Java.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unity does not block the volume controls on <strong>Daydream</strong> controller, so if you only intend to use the controller in your game you may decide not to extend the <strong>UnityPlayerActivity</strong> at all.</p>
<h3 id="overriding-daydream-android-libraries"><strong>Overriding Daydream Android libraries</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Daydream SDK</strong> for Unity provides two libraries to support development for Daydream devices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Daydream native library: <em>gvr.aar</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Google Protobuf</a> Nano Java library: <em>libprotobuf-java-nano.jar</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can replace either of these libraries by placing different versions of the library files in the <strong><em>Assets/Plugins/Android</em></strong> folder in your project. Library file names must match exactly in order for them to be correctly overridden.</p>
<h3 id="stereo-rendering-methods"><strong>Stereo Rendering methods</strong></h3>
<p>Multi Pass rendering is supported on all Google VR platforms. <a href="Android-SinglePassStereoRendering.html">Single Pass rendering</a> is supported only by Daydream on platforms that support driver level instancing.</p>
<h2 id="supported-apis-and-sdks"><strong>Supported APIs and SDKs</strong></h2>
<p>This section gives an overview of the supported APIs and SDKs for developing Google VR applications with Unity.</p>
<h3 id="unity-api-support"><strong>Unity API support</strong></h3>
<p>The following APIs are <strong>not</strong> <strong>supported</strong> by Google VR for Unity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="ScriptRef:XR.XRDevice.html">XRSettings.showDeviceView</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="ScriptRef:XR.XRSettings.html">XRDevice.isPresent</a></p>

<td style="text-align:left">I have a problem with GvrController/GvrViewer/GvrXXXX/Instant Preview. What do I do to resolve this?<br></td>
<td style="text-align:left">These types are part of the Google VR SDK for Unity and are owned and supported by Google. While the general Unity community may be able to answer your questions, for any technical issues you should visit the <a href="https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk">Google VR SDK for Unity</a> site on GitHUB.<br></td>

<td style="text-align:left">When is the Daydream Keyboard going to be released?</td>
<td style="text-align:left">The Daydream Keyboard for Google VR is a Google technology and will be released in some future version of the core Android system. Access and use of this technology is based solely on Google and the <a href="https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk">Google VR SDK for Unity</a>.<br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">I am trying to build my Cardboard for iOS project, but Xcode is reporting linker errors.</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Google distributes the Cardboard Native Development Kit (NDK) for iOS through the Cocoapods library management system. Unity is integrated with a specific version of that Cardboard NDK from the Cocoapods manager and uses the NDK to create your XCode project. The resulting project is generated differently from a standard Unity project. Cocoapods creates a wrapping XCode workspace containing the Unity project as well as a project for the Cardboard NDK library and its dependencies. Always make sure that you open and/or use the workspace and not just the project to avoid getting linker errors due to the missing libraries from Cocoapods.</td>
