<li>Added options for internal naming of asset bundles.  This will allow for deterministic naming to avoid unintended diffs for content updates.</li>
<li>The &quot;Ignore Invalid/Unsupported Files&quot; option is now saved in the settings</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Filename only bundle naming schemas were overwriting old bundles prematurely in content update.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="11617---2021-02-25">[1.16.17] - 2021-02-25</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated group rename logic to support engine AssetDatabase fix. Change should be transparent to users.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="11616---2021-01-20">[1.16.16] - 2021-01-20</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated dependency versions for testcase fix</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="11615---2020-12-09">[1.16.15] - 2020-12-09</h2>
<ul>
<li>Addressables link.xml should now have it&#39;s own folder.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where InvalidKeyException was getting thrown when calling GetDownloadSizeAsync on scenes</li>
<li>Resources folders inside Unity packages now get added to the Built In Data group</li>
<li>Fixed issue where getting selected subasset would cause an error if any subassets&#39; type was null</li>

<h2 id="11613---2020-11-18">[1.16.13] - 2020-11-18</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added option to invert the display of CheckBundleDupeDependencies Analyze rule</li>
<li>Fix GatherEntryLocations for scenes when parameter type is null</li>
<li>Added some API docs for RuntimeBuildLog and AnalyzeResultData that were missing.</li>
<li>Updated docs to explain the use of profile variables a little better.</li>
<li>Added ability to toggle Check Duplicate Bundle Dependencies analyze rule results to be arranged by Group or Asset</li>
<li>Allow assets that are inside a com.unity* package to be marked as addressable</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="11610---2020-11-04">[1.16.10] - 2020-11-04</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added internal naming option for the Bundled Asset Group Schema.  Instead of using the full path, there are options to use the asset guid or the hashcode of the guid.  These values are stable and wont change if the asset path changes, reducing the need to rebuild a bundle if paths change but contents do not.  The internal ids stored in the content catalog will generally be shorter than asset paths - 32 bytes for the full guid, 8 bytes for the guid hash. </li>
<li>Added option to exclude sub catalog entries by file extension</li>
<li>Added options to exclude catalog entries for address, labels, and guids</li>
<li>Added option to optimize catalog size by extracting duplicated string in urls and file paths</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="1167---2020-10-21">[1.16.7] - 2020-10-21</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where InvalidHandle errors were getting thrown if an operation failed with releaseDependenciesOnFailure turned on.</li>
<li>Fixed group build and load paths not being saved when editing multiple groups at once</li>
<li>Changed Analyze Result data to be cached in the Library.  Result data was previously stored in Assets/AddressableAssetsData/AnalyzeData/AnalyzeRuleData.asset.  It is now stored in Library/com.unity/addressables/AnalyzeData/AnalyzeRuleData.json.  If detected, the Assets - version of the Analyze data will be automatically cleaned up.</li>
<li>Fixed line in AsyncOperationHandle documentation that told the wrong API for acquiring a handle</li>
<li>Moved the content update documents to their own page.  Expanded and clarified information on the update process</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Group hierarchy support in groups window by detecting &#39;-&#39; in group name<ul>
<li>This can be turned on &amp; off in the addressable asset settings inspector: Group Hierarchy with Dashes</li>
<li>This only affects the visual display, groups are still stored in the main settings object in a flat list</li>
<li>The group name is unaffected.  If you name a group &quot;x-y-z&quot; that will be it&#39;s name, but, with the option on, it will display as if it was in a folder called &quot;y&quot; that was inside a folder called &quot;x&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed fast mode resource locator Keys property to expand all possible keys when accessed.  For large projects with many addressable entries and folders, this property may be slow when called for the first time.</li>

<li>Fixed issue where assets in Resources weren&#39;t show full key in Groups window</li>
<li>Fixed issue where loading Addressables from a different project was throwing errors.</li>
<li>Fixed WriteSerializedFiles profile event timings when using the detailed build log</li>
<li>Selecting multiple Resources and checking &quot;addressable&quot; now display a single popup</li>
<li>Fixed CreateArrayResult wouldn&#39;t work with classes derived from Object, only the base class, so not for ScriptableObject. Also added test</li>
<li>Fixed exceptions not handled while loading ContentCatalog</li>
<li>Fixed issue where passing false into releaseDependenciesOnFailure was still releasing dependencies on failure</li>
<li>Fixed issue where failed operations could over release their dependencies.</li>
<li>Changes to an AssetReference rendered by AssetReferenceDrawer now register as a GUI change</li>

<li>Changed keys parameter for many Addressables APIs to be IEnumerable instead of IList<object>.  This allows for passing collections of AssetReferences or AssetLabelReferences directly instead of requiring them to be copied into a new List<object>.</object></object></li>
<li>Fix bug where lists of AssetReferenceSprites were not displayed or set right by AssetReferenceDrawer. Also fixed where multiple selected objects in project hierarchy couldn&#39;t set all lists of AssetReferences elements.</li>

<li>By default, the new parameter is true, and all successful parts will be released.  The .Result on the returned handle will be null and Status will be Failed</li>
<li>When false, the returned .Result will be a List of size matching the number of matching locations.  Any failed location will correlate to null in the List, while successful locations will correlate to valid objects in the List.  Status will still be Failed in this scenario.</li>

<li>ReleaseInstance will now return a bool saying if it successfully destroyed the instance.

<li>Added ResourceType to IResourceLocation.<ul>
<li>This allows you to know the type of a location before loading it.</li>
<li>Fixes a problem where calling Load*<type>(key) would load all items that matched the key, then filter based on type.  Now it will do the filter before loading (after looking up location matches)</type></li>
<li>This also adds a Type input to LoadResourceLocationsAsync.  null input will match all types.</li>

<ul>
<li><em>BREAKING CODE CHANGES</em><ul>
<li>Chagned all asynchronous methods to include the word Async in method name.  This fits better with Unity&#39;s history and convention.  They should auto upgrade without actually breaking your game.</li>

<ul>
<li>Removed support for .NET 3.x as it is deprecated for Unity in general.</li>
<li>Replaced IAsyncOperation with AsyncOperationHandle.<ul>
<li>Once the asset is no longer needed, the user can call Addressables.Release, passing in either the handle, or the result the handle provided.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exposed AsyncOperationBase for creating custom operations<ul>
<li>These operations must be started by ResourceManager.StartOperation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Replaced IDataBuilderContext and it&#39;s inherited classes with simpler AddressablesDataBuilderInput.  This class is fed into all IDataBuilder.BuildData calls.</li>
<li>Fixed Nintendo Switch and PlayStation4 support.</li>
<li>Simplified the IResourceProvider interface.</li>
<li>Refactored build script interface.  Made BuildScriptBase and the provided concrete versions easier to inherit from.</li>
<li>Removed DelayedActionManager.</li>
<li>Removed ISceneProvider. Users can implement custom scene loading using a custom AsyncOperationBase.</li>
<li>Removed optional LRU caching of Assets and Bundles.</li>
<li>Addressables Profiler now tracks all active async operations</li>
<li>AssetBundles targetting StreamingAssets (by using the profile variable [UnityEngine.AddressableAssets.Addressables.BuildPath] now build to the Library instead of StreamingAssets.  During the player build, these files are copied into StreamingAssets, then after the build, the copies are deleted. They are also built into platform specific folders (so building for a second platform will not overwrite data from a first build).  We recommend deleting anything in Assets/StreamingAssets/aa.</li>
<li>The addressables_content_state.bin is built into a platform specific folder within Assets/AddressableAssetsData/.  We recommend deleting the addressables_content_state.bin in Assets/AddressableAssetsData to avoid future confusion.</li>
<li>ScriptableBuildPipeline now purges stale data from its cache in the background after each build.</li>
<li>Disabled Addressables automatic initialization.  It will now initialize itself upon the first call into it (such as Load or Instantiate).  To Initialize on startup instead of first use, call Addressables.Initialize().</li>
<li>Optimized performance around instantiation and general garbage generation.</li>
<li>Added per-group bundle compression settings.</li>
<li>Fixes to AssetReference drawers.</li>
<li>Improved the group template system for creating better defined asset groups.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in bundle caching that caused GetDownloadSize to report incorrectly</li>
<li>Cleaned up Load/Release calls to make sure all releases could take either the handle returned by Load, or the handle.Result.</li>
<li>Added editor-only analytics (nothing added in runtime).  If you have Analytics disabled in your project nothing will be reported. Currently only run when you build addressables, it includes data such as Addressables version and Build Script name.</li>
<li>Fixed null ref issue when cleaning all the data builders</li>
<li>KNOWN ISSUE: there is still an occasional issue with code stripping on iOS.  If you run into iOS issues, try turning stripping off for now.</li>

<ul>
<li><em>BREAKING CODE CHANGES</em><ul>
<li>to ease code navigation, we have added several layers of namespace to the code.</li>
<li>All Instantiate API calls (Addressables and AssetReference) have been changed to only work with GameObjects.</li>
<li>any hardcoded profile path to com.unity.addressables (specifically LocalLoadPath, RemoteLoadPath, etc) should use UnityEngine.AddressableAssets.Addressables.RuntimePath instead.
  For build paths, replace Assets/StreamingAssets/com.unity.addressables/[BuildTarget] with [UnityEngine.AddressableAssets.Addressables.BuildPath]/[BuildTarget]
  For load paths,  replace Assets/StreamingAssets/com.unity.addressables/[BuildTarget] with {UnityEngine.AddressableAssets.Addressables.RuntimePath}/[BuildTarget]</li>
<li>We have removed attribute AssetReferenceTypeRestriction as it is cleaner to enforce type via generics</li>
<li>Attribute AssetReferenceLabelRestriction is renamed to AssetReferenceUILabelRestriction and must be surrounded by #if UNITY_EDITOR in your game code, to enforce it&#39;s editor-only capability</li>
<li>Modifications to IResourceProvider API.</li>
<li>Removed PreloadDependencies API.  Instead use DownloadDependencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Content Update calculation has changed, this will invalide previously generated addressables_content_state.bin files.<ul>
<li>Some types for content update were made private as a result of the above change.</li>

</li>
<li>Minimum Unity version is now 2018.3 to address a build-time bug with progressive lightmapper.</li>
<li>Moved all of the Resource Manager package to be contained within Addressables (no longer a stand alone package).  No code change implications.</li>
<li>Change to content catalog building:<ul>
<li>Previous model built one catalog per group, wherever that group built it&#39;s data.</li>
<li>New model builds one catalog locally, and optionally one &quot;remote&quot;.  Remote location is set on the top level AddressableAssetSettings object.</li>
<li>Loading will now always check if remote has changes (if remote exists), and use local otherwise (or cached version of remote).</li>

<li>LoadScene API now takes the LoadSceneParameters that were added to the engine in 2018.2</li>
<li>Exposed AddressablesBuildDataBuilderContext.BuildScriptContextConstants for use in build scripts.</li>
<li>Refactored AddressablesBuildDataBuilderContext.GetValue to take default parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed Scene asset path to be consistent between different play modes in the catalog data.</li>
<li>Exposed the various IDataBuilder implementations as public classes.</li>
<li>Exposed asset and bundle provider types for BundledAssetGroupSchema.</li>
<li>Fixed several bugs when loading catalogs from other projects.</li>
<li>Added provider suffix to Initialization operation and Addressables.LoadCatalogsFromRuntimeData API to better support overriding providers.</li>
<li>Exposed CachedProvider options in BundledAssetGroupSchema.  Each unique set of parameters will generate a separate provider.  There is also an option to force a group to have its own providers.</li>
<li>Added IEnumerable<object> Keys property to IResourceLocator interface.</object></li>
<li>Exposed InitializationOperation as public API.</li>
<li>Added BuildTarget to ResourceManagerRuntimeData.  This is used to check if the generated player content was built with the same build target as the player or the editor when entering play mode.</li>

<li>Fixed error case where an asset (usually a bundle) was loaded multiple times as different types (object and AssetBundle).</li>
<li>Fixed divide by zero bug when computing load percent of simulated asset bundles.</li>
<li>AddressableAssetBuildResult.CreateResult now takes the settingsPath as a parameter to pass this to the result.</li>
<li>Fix AssetReference GUI when the AssetReference is inside an array of classes, part of a SerializedObject, or private.</li>
<li>Fix AssetReferenceSprite to properly support sprites (as opposed to Texture2D&#39;s).</li>

<li><em>IMPORTANT CHANGE TO BUILDING</em><ul>
<li>We have disabled automatic asset bundle building.  That used to happen when you built the player, or entered play mode in &quot;packed mode&quot;.  This is no longer the case.  You must now select &quot;Build-&gt;Build Player Content&quot; from the Addressables window, or call AddressableAssetSettings.BuildPlayerContent().  We did this because we determined that automatic building did not scale well at all for large projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fixed regression loading local bundles</li>
<li>Added Addressables.DownloadDependencies() interface</li>
<li>fixes for Nintendo Switch support</li>
<li>Fixed issues around referencing Addressables during an Awake() call</li>
<li>Code refactor and naming convention fixes</li>
<li>Cleaned up missing docs</li>
<li>Content update now handles not having and groups marked as Static Content</li>
<li>Fixed errors when browing for the addressables_content_state.bin and cancelling</li>
<li>Moved addressables_content_state.bin to be generated into the addressables settings folder</li>
<li>Changed some exceptions when releasing null bundles to warnings to handle the case of releasing a failed download operation</li>
<li>Separated hash and crc options to allow them to be used independently in asset bundle loads.</li>
<li>Use CRC in AssetBundle.LoadFromFileAsync calls if specified</li>
<li>Always include AssetBundleRequestOptions for asset bundle locations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="048-preview---2018-10-22">[0.4.8-preview] - 2018-10-22</h2>

<li>MINIMUM RECOMMENDED VERSION - 2018.2.11+<ul>
<li>We have re-enabled the addressables checkbox. Versions of 2018.2 older than the .11 release will work unless you attempt to view the Animation Import Settings inspector.  If you do have animations you need to inspect, use .11+. If you do not, use any official release version of 2018.2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>refactored the way IResourceProviders are initialized in the player - serialized data is constructed at runtime to control how the providers are configured</li>
<li>added readonly custom inspector for AddressableAssetEntryCollection</li>
<li>AssetReference now stores the loaded asset which can be accessed via the Asset property after LoadAsset completes.  ReleaseAsset has been modified to not need the asset passed in (the old version is marked obsolete]</li>
<li>fixed profiler details view not updating when a mouse drag is completed</li>
<li>fixed null-ref when moving Resources to Addressables when there are no Resources</li>
<li>blocked moving EditorSceneList within GUI</li>
<li>fixed cap on address name length</li>
<li>fixed workflows of marking Resources as addressable and moving an addressable into Resources.</li>
<li>fixed issue where AssetReferenceDrawer did not mark scene as dirty when changed.</li>
<li>added Hosting Services feature; provides extensible framework and implementation for serving packed content to player builds from the Editor</li>
<li>replaced addressables buildscript with an interface based system.  IDataBuilder class is now used to define builders of specific types of data.  The Addressables settings object
contains a collection of data builders and uses these to create player and play mode data.  Users can implemented custom data builders to control the build process.</li>
<li>replaced AssetGroupProcessors with a collection of AssetGroupSchema objects.  The difference is that the schema objects only contain data and groups can have multiple schemas.  The
logic for processing groups now resides in the build script and uses the schemas as data sources and filters for how to build.</li>
<li>Added Initialization objects that can be created during the build to run during addressables initialization</li>
<li>Implemented Caching API initialization with initialization objects</li>
<li>Changed some API and tests to work with 2019.x</li>
<li>fixed how AssetReference&#39;s draw when within lists, arrays, or contained classes</li>
<li>Fixed the workflow of scenes moving in and out of the Editor Build Settings Scene list.</li>
<li>Removed &quot;Preview&quot; and added &quot;Analyze&quot;.<ul>
<li>The new system runs any rules it knows about.</li>
<li>Currently this is one rule that is manually set up in code. Future work will have additional rules, and expose the ability to create/add user- or project-specific rules</li>
<li>This process can be slow, as it runs most of a build to get accurate data.</li>
<li>Within the Analyze window there is a &quot;fix&quot; button that allows each rule to fix any issues if the rule knows how.</li>
<li>The current rule is a &quot;check duplicate asset&quot; rule. This looks for assets that are pulled into multiple asset bundles due to dependency calculations. The way it fixes things is to move all of those into a newly created group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added option to toggle logging of all exceptions within the Resource Manager</li>
<li>Refactored initialization of the addressable asset settings to prevent it getting into a bad state.</li>
