####Animation Clip Node<em>:
A node in a Blend Tree graph that contains an animation clip, such as a run or walk animation. <a href="class-BlendTree.html#AnimationClipNode">More info</a>

####animation compression</em>:
The method of compressing animation data to significantly reduce file sizes without causing a noticable reduction in motion quality. Animation compression is a trade off between saving on memory and image quality. <a href="class-AnimationClip#AssetProperties">More info</a>

####Animation Curves<em>:
Allows you to add data to an imported clip so you can animate the timings of other items based on the state of an animator. For example, for a game set in icy conditions, you could use an extra animation curve to control the emission rate of a particle system to show the player&#39;s condensing breath in the cold air. <a href="AnimationCurvesOnImportedClips.html">More info</a>

####Animation Event</em>:
Allows you to add data to an imported clip which determines when certain actions should occur in time with the animation. For example, for an animated character you might want to add events to walk and run cycles to indicate when the footstep sounds should play. <a href="AnimationEventsOnImportedClips.html">More info</a>

####Animation Layer<em>:
An Animation Layer contains an Animation State Machine that controls animations of a model or part of it. An example of this is if you have a full-body layer for walking or jumping and a higher layer for upper-body motions such as throwing an object or shooting. The higher layers take precedence for the body parts they control. <a href="AnimationLayers.html">More info</a>

####Animation Parameters</em>:
Used to communicate between scripting and the Animator Controller. Some parameters can be set in scripting and used by the controller, while other parameters are based on Custom Curves in Animation Clips and can be sampled using the scripting API. <a href="AnimationParameters.html">More info</a>

####Animation State Machine<em>:
A graph within an Animator Controller that controls the interaction of Animation States. Each state references an Animation Blend Tree or a single Animation Clip. <a href="AnimationStateMachines.html">More info</a>

####Animation Transition</em>:
Allows a state machine to switch or blend from one animation state to another. Transitions define how long a blend between states should take, and the conditions that activate them. <a href="StateMachineTransitions.html">More info</a>

####Animator Component<em>:

####Animator Controller</em>:
Controls animation through Animation Layers with Animation State Machines and Animation Blend Trees, controlled by Animation Parameters. The same Animator Controller can be referenced by multiple models with Animator components. <a href="class-AnimatorController.html">More info</a>

####Animator Override Controller<em>:

The window where the Animator Controller is visualized and edited. <a href="AnimatorWindow.html">More info</a>

####Avatar<em>:
An interface for retargeting animation from one rig to another. <a href="ConfiguringtheAvatar.html">More info</a>

The pose at which the character was modelled. 

####blend:
Transition from one animation to another animation smoothly and seamlessly, such as blending a character&#39;s walking and running animations according to the character&#39;s speed. 

####Blend Node</em>:
A node in a Blend Tree graph that blends animation clip nodes. <a href="class-BlendTree#BlendNodes">More info</a>

####Body Transform:
The mass center of the character. It is used in for animation retargeting and provides the most stable displacement model. <a href="RootMotion.html">More info</a>

####Direct Blend Tree<em>:
A Blend Tree that allows you to map animator parameters directly to the weight of a Blend Tree child. This is useful when you want to have exact control over the  animations that are being blended rather than blend them indirectly using one or two parameters (in the case of 1D and 2D blend trees). <a href="BlendTree-DirectBlending.html">More info</a>

####forward kinematics</em>:
A method of posing a skeleton for animation by rotating the joint angles to predetermined values. The position of a child joint changes according to the rotation of its parent and so the end point of a chain of joints can be determined from the angles and relative positions of the individual joints it contains. 

####Human template<em>:
A pre-defined bone-mapping. Used for matching bones from FBX files to the Avatar. <a href="class-HumanTemplate.html">More info</a>

####Humanoid animation</em>:
An animation using humanoid skeletons. Humanoid models generally have the same basic structure, representing the major articulate parts of the body, head and limbs. This makes it easy to map animations from one humanoid skeleton to another, allowing retargeting and inverse kinematics. <a href="ConfiguringtheAvatar.html">More info</a>

####inverse kinematics (IK)<em>:
The automatic calculation of joint angles (eg. the shoulder and elbow joint of an arm) so that the end point (eg. the hand) reaches a desired point in space. In contrast to <strong>Forward Kinematics</strong> <a href="InverseKinematics.html">More info</a>

####keyframe</em>:
A frame that marks the start or end point of a transition in an animation.  Frames in between the keyframes are called inbetweens. 

####Keyframe Reduction<em>:
A process that removes redundant keyframes. <a href="class-AnimationClip.html#AssetProperties">More info</a>

####kinematics</em>:
The geometry that describes the position and orientation of a character&#39;s joints and bodies. Used by inverse kinematics to control character movement. 

####Loop Pose<em>:
An animation clip setting that blends the end and start of an animation to create a seamless join. <a href="class-AnimationClip.html">More info</a>

####Muscle definition</em>:
This allows you to have more intuitive control over the character&#39;s skeleton. When an Avatar is in place, the Animation system works in muscle space, which is more intuitive than bone space. <a href="MuscleDefinitions.html">More info</a>

####Ping Pong:
To repeatedly play an animation to the end, then in reverse back to the beginning, in a loop. 

####Playable Graph<em>:
An API for controlling Playables. Playable Graphs allow you to create, connect and destroy playables. <a href="Playables-Graph.html">More info</a>

####Playables</em>:
An API that provides a way to create tools, effects or other gameplay mechanisms by organizing and evaluating data sources in a tree-like structure known as the PlayableGraph. <a href="Playables.html">More info</a>

####Retargeting<em>:
Applying animations created for one model to another. <a href="Retargeting.html">More info</a>

####Rigging</em>:
The process of building a skeleton hierarchy of joints for your mesh. Performed with an external tool, such as Blender or Autodesk Maya. <a href="UsingHumanoidChars.html">More info</a>

####Root Motion<em>:
Motion of character&#39;s root node, whether it&#39;s controlled by the animation itself or externally. <a href="RootMotion.html">More info</a>
