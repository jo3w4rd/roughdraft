Thanks for using the Underwater object floating script!

First off there are two versions of this script in the package
a C# version and JavaScript version so that people using a specific
language can be consistent.  They both work exactly the same way.

Setup is fairly easy and can be done in a few simple steps.

1.Drag the floating script into your project.
2.Choose the object you want to be floating underwater and add a rigidbody to it.
3.Turn gravity off on the rigidbody and drag the floating script onto it.
4.Edit the values in the inspector to your liking.

-There are four different values that you can edit
Vertical Speed
Vertical Distance
Horizontal Speed
Spin Speed

Horizontal Speed & Spin Speed are set on start() so editing them during runtime will
not do anything, you must edit it and then play to test.

You may edit this script as much as you want and make it your own, but may not sell it.
